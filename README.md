# Game Maker Developer Console

Sometimes it's helpful to be able to change values whilst your game is running in order to fine tune things. 
Setting up a testing environment can be a big job all in itself...that's where the GameMaker Developer Console comes in!

You can drop this collection of scripts and object into any GameMaker project, and it will add a professional looking console for entering commands.
